      "title": "Causal Discovery in Python",
      "abstract": "A review and comparison of software available for causal discovery in Python. Causal discovery means learning \"what causes what\" from your data. The input is a tabular dataset; the output is a causal graphical model (or a set of potential models) over your features. If feature A affects feature B, there should be an arrow A-->B in the causal graphical model. Causal discovery is useful for hypothesis generation, experiment selection, and for testing our assumptions around causation.\r\n\r\nI'll give a brief intro to causal discovery, then review the following packages: py-tetrad, causal-learn, tigramite, causalnex, and cdt (causal discovery toolbox). The packages have some overlap but different emphases: each one implements at least one algorithm not covered by the other packages, making them useful in different situations. If time permits I'll finish with a quick demo, showing each package learning a model from the same dataset.",

      "abstract": "Sick of writing lots of dedicated methods to perform the same tasks? Want to write less code? This talk may be for you! \r\n\r\nREST API's are ubiquitious, and a very useful way to send and recieve data from various services. However, building them can often feel repetitive and boring. So, because I was lazy, and sick of doing it I decided to override specific dunder methods to write less boiler plate code, and keep myself interested.\r\n\r\nWas it easier? Probably not. Did it require less work than a normal implementation? Also probably not. Did it make my code more readable and portable? Definitely not. But it was fun, and I learnt how overriding Python's magic methods - often called dunders - could be useful. Let me share the lessons I learnt with you and inspire your own ideas.",

      "abstract": "There are around 6,200 primary schools around Australia, and the curriculum has a requirement to teach Digital Technologies, which includes a coding portion.  There are many challenges here, not least which is enabling the approximately 150,000 primary school teachers with the skills and resources to teach programming to young students.  The AustSTEM foundation was set up to assist in this area, and developed a MicroPython based learning platform, which consists of a pocket-sized computing device that integrates with a web-based coding and teaching environment.  The teaching material has many hands-on activities, with connections to nature and science.  In this talk we will discuss this teaching platform, how it can help students transition from block-based programming to textual coding, and show some of the successes we have had so far in Australian classrooms.",

      "abstract": "Verifying, evaluating or interpreting complex data requires specialist tools and methods. Many data scientists, programmers and scientists will be familiar with some evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error or true positive rate. There are many situations where these scores are insufficient for assessing correctness, accuracy or suitability of a model or prediction. The challenge of verifying models and predictions affects most fields of science, engineering, and many machine learning applications.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce \"scores\", an open source Python package for verifying and evaluating labelled, n-dimensional (multidimensional) data at any scale. \"scores\" includes over 50 metrics, statistical techniques and data processing tools. The software repository can be found at https://github.com/nci/scores and the documentation can be found at https://scores.readthedocs.io/ .\r\n\r\nThis talk is suitable for beginner, intermediate and expert audiences. Developers and data scientists who are familiar mainly with tabular data, such as supported by the pandas library, may be interested in the additional functionality offered by \"scores\" (and the xarray library it utilises). For those learning about more advanced methods, every metric and statistical test has a companion Jupyter Notebook tutorial. For expert users already familiar with these ideas, you may be interested in some of the novel scoring methods not commonly found in other packages. \r\n\r\nCome to this talk to hear about:\r\n - The difference between tabular data, n-dimensional data, and labelled n-dimensional data\r\n - Examples of using a common metric from \"scores\" on labelled, n-dimensional data\r\n - Examples of using \"scores\" for interrogating data in multiple dimensions\r\n - Examples of where basic methods overlook important considerations\r\n - Examples of using some of the more complex metrics in \"scores\"",

This interface automatically generates Gaussian statistics. It includes pages for both one positioner and one detector (1D) or two positioners and one detector (2D), and allows users to click on a 2D Gaussian to take horizontal and vertical slices.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will discuss best programming practices, such as implementing unit tests, maintaining DRY principles, and using linting tools to improve code quality. Good programming practices work beautifully in a scientific environment.  Join us to learn how these techniques can enhance your work with Python.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade, this school has consistently exceeded VCE expectations in Software Development, largely due to well-developed resources, consistency in use of programming language (Visual Basic) and progression of skills through year 7 to year 12. However, a gap analysis in the teaching methodology has highlighted conceptual computational thinking and problem-solving skills as a key gap in the current offering. This was attributed to the curriculum's skills-based focus and the Covid-era teaching practice of flipped learning via video tutorials.  \r\n\r\nThis has presented an opportunity to overhaul the teaching methodology to focus on equipping students with the skills to apply their learning in different contexts.  Some key aspects of this transformation include a more live coding technique and transitioning to Python as the preferred programming language, due to its versatility and future prospects for students.  \r\n\r\nWe present this roadmap which leads to a complete overhaul of our teaching programmes from year 7 to year 12, scaffolding Python across Applied Computing, STEM projects, Robotics and Game development over the next 6 months.",

Beginners may also lack confidence or are easily demotivated, which can hinder learning. To assist students in developing these skills and build confidence we created a set of playful programming challenges and competition using Karel the Robot. The Karel system provides a 2D \u201cgrid world\u201d where the Karel character can move and interact with its environment. The 2D world is visualised for students so that they can immediately see how their program changes the environment step by step as well as the final program state. This is in contrast to traditional languages where learners must develop and maintain a mental model of the program state. This talk will cover our approach, preliminary results and feedback from students showing an increase in confidence and interest in programming. We will also share how this approach can be applied to other learning contexts.",

The time I spent in developing the Python scripts could then be offset by the efficiency and accuracy I gained from the automation. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will demonstrate how to populate student details into their individual Excel mark sheets, check marking mistakes, automate mark adjustment and collect data from individual mark sheets. \r\n\r\nWhile the above automation can be achieved using standard tools offered by Microsoft by putting the programming logic into Excel formulae or Visual Basic for Application, I will argue using Python to separate the logic from data is a better approach in terms of programming practice and Cybersecurity.",

Given a complex dataset, they may feel tempted to use simple summary statistics like the mean, median, or standard deviation to describe it. However, these numbers are not a replacement for visualizing the distribution.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this fact, researchers have generated many datasets that are very different visually, but share the same summary statistics. In this talk, I will discuss *Data Morph*, an open source package that builds on previous research using simulated annealing to perturb an arbitrary input dataset into a variety of shapes, while preserving the mean, standard deviation, and correlation to multiple decimal points.

Using python packages, such as scikit-image and tsfresh,  I will demonstrate how we extract morphological and spatiotemporal features of cells. We use these features to train a supervised machine learning (ML) model to predict which drug treatment the cells were exposed to. \r\nFurthermore, using explainable AI with Shapley values, we identify key feature combinations that distinguish the cellular response to each drug.

These samples are irradiated with X-rays in order to uncover their atomic crystal structures. Amongst our research areas, we study applications in mining, solar cells, perovskites, hydrogen storage, and geology, where understanding material properties at the atomic level can lead to advancements such as enhancing mineral extraction processes, improving solar cell efficiency, developing better hydrogen storage solutions, and analysing the composition of meteorites.\r\n\r\nTo ensure good data quality, the capillary needs to rotate precisely around its centre of rotation in front of the X-ray beam. Alignment of the centre of rotation is usually a manual operation that relies on the human eye and expertise to discern that the capillary is straight and stationary while it rotates around its axis; this process can be lengthy, error-prone, and difficult to achieve, especially for non-experts.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate how we have united Python, OpenCV, and motion control systems to automate the capillary alignment procedure at the Australian Synchrotron, reducing the time to align a sample from several minutes to just 10 seconds.",

It combines the disciplines of biology, computer science, and mathematics. If this seems daunting, don\u2019t panic, because this talk will focus on two open-source Python packages I have developed, FASTQE and Biomojify, that make common bioinformatics file formats intuitive and accessible\u2026. by using emoji.\r\n\r\nFASTQE simplifies DNA sequencing data analysis by taking numerical quality scores for the data, and summarising them using emoji to quickly convey the good, the bad, and the ugly of sequence data quality. Whether for training, outreach, or debugging, this tool can easily turn unremarkable data quality analysis into an appealing visualisation.\r\n\r\nBiomojify takes the concept further by converting plain text data to use emoji. In DNA, for example, the conventional format represents  individual A, C, G, and T nucleotides as plain text. Biomojify substitutes them with emojis such as avocado, cheese, grape, and tomato. It supports various bioinformatics file formats and supports user defined emoji mapping. It can be used to teach the underlying biological concepts behind bioinformatics data, by simplifying specialised data structures for a general audience. \r\n\r\nScience communication is hard. These tools transform complex bioinformatics data into engaging, emoji-based visualisations, making bioinformatics concepts more accessible and adding an element of fun to scientific education and communication.",

      "title": "Introducing Potnia: A Python language library for the conversion of ancient texts to Unicode",
      "abstract": "The last five years have seen a significant increase in the application of machine learning to the study of ancient scripts. Applications are broad, and include recognition via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), textual restoration, palaeographic analysis, topic modelling, representation learning, decipherment and machine translation (Sommerschield 2023). A large number of ancient language corpora have been digitised in recent decades, supporting this research. However, while the necessary Unicode blocks for many of these ancient scripts are available, a number of these data sets are still presented as Romanised transliterations.\r\n\r\nIn response to this situation, we have created Potnia (https://pypi.org/project/potnia/), an open-source Python language library under the Apache 2.0 license, designed to convert such transliterated texts to Unicode. The session image accompanying this proposal provides an example of Potnia\u2019s conversion process, with a Romanised transliteration of a Linear B text as the input, and the Unicode representation of this same text as the output. This conversion is crucial for downstream machine learning tasks, as tokenisation in the original Unicode script allows for more accurate representation of linguistic structures and mitigates potential biases introduced by transliteration.\r\n\r\nPotnia's flexible architecture, built on Python's object-oriented principles, employs string manipulation techniques and regular expressions to handle various complexities inherent in ancient texts, such as uncertain readings, missing elements, and script-specific notations. At present, the library can be used for Linear B texts, with functionality for Linear A, Sumerian and Akkadian soon to follow.\r\n\r\nPotnia's design allows for easy addition of new scripts, each with its own set of rules for tokenisation, regularisation, and character mapping. This extensibility positions us well for future inclusion of additional scripts. To ensure reliability and facilitate open-source contributions, we've implemented a comprehensive test suite using pytest, with test cases defined in YAML files for easy expansion. This approach covers key functionalities across different scripts and simplifies the process of adding new test scenarios as the library grows.\r\n\r\n<b><em>References</em></b>\r\nSommerschield, T., Y.

Specifications such as environment markers, custom backends, and static build configurations have been introduced. Additionally new package managers like Poetry and Hatch have emerged.\r\n\r\nYet despite the updates, many projects are still living in the 2010s - using a setup.py file to specify the build configuration for their package. setup.py is notoriously difficult to learn and a common vector for launching attacks during install.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss why it's time to move away from using setup.py and how to do it.\r\n\r\nWe will see how setup.py is used and abused - from downloading huge datasets (*cough* AI *cough*), modifying the system, and most critically how malicious payloads can be included to execute when setup.py is evaluated. Arbitrary code in setup.py makes security analysis harder and creates more work for PyPI administrators.\r\n\r\nThe talk will detail the new (as of 7 years ago) methods of describing build configurations in pyproject.toml and setup.cfg, giving examples of how to use these methods. The examples will include how to achieve what once required dynamic code to include data like readme contents, version numbers and requirements. The limits of pyproject.toml and setup.cfg will also be covered.\r\n\r\nFinally, the talk will outline how moving away from setup.py improves the Python packaging universe, how it makes life easier for ensuring Python security, and what can be done to drive adoption of pyproject.toml.",

      "abstract": "Being a fast-paced startup and developing a completely new product in the Space Industry is very challenging, and moving fast wasn\u2019t just a requirement but essential. It's the kind of environment that is hard to think too much ahead, and for that reason, our database was created to address the problems we had at hand. \r\nAfter a while, new products and features were required, and our database couldn't handle all of them. That\u2019s when we decided to move our data to a newly designed database instance with proper relationships, able to handle more features, higher workloads and scalable. During the planning phase, several approaches were discussed, such as creating a script to copy the data and some off-the-shelf software that we thought could handle that for us. However, the complexity of implementing those approaches wasn\u2019t feasible with our deadlines for releasing the new product. So, we decided to copy the data using Django ORM (our product was already using Django), the idea was to avoid the complexity of creating complex SQL Queries to copy data to new tables while keeping the data consistency and integrity.\r\nIn this presentation, we aim to demonstrate how our database was limiting the company\u2019s scalability and how we fixed those problems by migrating to a new database schema whilst maintaining two database instances, one for internal operations and the other for customer-facing functions. Moreover, we show how we did that using object-oriented programming in combination with Django\u2019s ORM to migrate our database without the need to handle complex SQL commands to copy data, keep relationships, and create new ones.",
